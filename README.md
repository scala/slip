# THIS REPOSITORY IS NOW OBSOLETE

SLIP (the Scala Library Improvement Process) is dead.

SIP (Scala Improvement Process) lives on and SPP (Scala Platform Process) is born,
both under the management of the Scala Center.

http://www.scala-lang.org/community/ will be kept up-to-date with current links.

This repository remains in place as an archive of past proposals and
discussions.
