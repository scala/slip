# THIS REPOSITORY IS NOW OBSOLETE

SLIP (the Scala Library Improvement Process) is dead.

[SIP (Scala Improvement Process)](https://scala-lang.org/sips) lives on and [SPP (Scala Platform Process)](https://platform.scala-lang.org) is born,
both under the management of the Scala Center.

http://www.scala-lang.org/community/ will be kept up-to-date with current links.

This repository remains in place as an archive of past proposals and
discussions.
