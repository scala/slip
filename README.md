# Scala Library Improvement Process

[![Chat](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/scala/slip)

The Scala Center has two ways of welcoming changes from the community: the SIP and the SLIP processes.
  
If you're interested in the new SIP process, go to the [official SIP website](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/sip-submission.html). Otherwise, the Scala Center is working on the formalization of the new **SLIP** process, which will be ready soon.

## Helping Out
[Helping Out]: #helping-out
If you would like to contribute to the Scala language and core libraries by volunteering your time, there are many ways you can do so. One option is to help us track, organize and manage the SIP/SLIP activities.

To volunteer to help us, please visit our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/scala/slip) for more general information and discussion.

You can also check the current list of SIP/SLIP [help wanted issues](https://github.com/scala/slip/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) which contain largely procedural work that help us stay on top of the SIP/SLIP process. These activities require little more than time, willingness and a level head. No explicit knowledge of Scala is required in order to help us out with these issues, although you are likely to learn a lot along the way. They include tasks like contacting and tracking SIP and SLIP owners for status updates, helping coordinate between developers working on SIP/SLIPs, and a lot more.

If you decide you want to help out with an issue, please add a comment to the effect that you are going to help in the comments for that issue. If you do produce results, please also update the issue with new comments to that effect. If you see an issue that has been "claimed" in the comments, but appears to have fallen dormant, please coordinate with the previous commenter and see if you can help out or take over. These tasks usually don't take more than a few hours at most, so if you see an issue that has not had any activity for a few days despite having been "claimed" by someone, feel free to either try and contact them or if unable to, take it over and get it moving again (add your own comment to that effect).

Finally, reviews of SIPs and SLIPs are encouraged. You get the Scala you help to shape, if you don't help to shape it, well then you get the Scala that others help to shape. If you want to have your voice heard, check out the [SIPs](https://github.com/scala/scala.github.com/pulls) and [SLIPs](https://github.com/scala/slip/pulls) and comment on them.
